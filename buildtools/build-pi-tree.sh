# Builds what the sokar-agent-pi package ships: the Pi coding agent with its dependencies, and
# the Node runtime it needs. Both end up inside the package, so a task image is built with no
# network access at all - see the 'packaged' section of pi.yaml.
#
# Everything runs in a pinned container rather than on the build machine, so no Node toolchain
# has to be installed to build Sokar, and the toolchain itself is a stated version rather than
# whatever the machine happens to have.
#
# Skipped, with a message, when there is no container runtime: the rest of Sokar still builds.
#
# Every container maps the build user in, so what it writes belongs to the build user. Without
# that, the tree is written as root and the next build cannot even delete it.
