# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Headings name this package's version; Pi's version is what the package ships and appears as an
entry rather than a heading. One sentence per change - `git log` has the detail.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- A push that changes only documents - Markdown, `mkdocs.yml`, `doc/` or `issues/` - no longer starts the build.
- The release tooling is `sokar-release` 0.4.1, whose shared checks of issue citations and the documentation chapter replace this repository's own tests.

## [0.4.0]

- Initial public version.
